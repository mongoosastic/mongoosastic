Mongoosastic is a [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) plugin that can automatically index your models into [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).


## Getting started

1. Install the package

```bash
npm install -S mongoosastic
```

2. Setup your mongoose model to use the plugin

```javascript
var mongoose     = require('mongoose')
  , mongoosastic = require('mongoosastic')
  , Schema       = mongoose.Schema

var User = new Schema({
    name: String
  , email: String
  , city: String
})

User.plugin(mongoosastic)
```

3. Query your Elasticsearch with the `search()` method (added by the plugin)

```javascript
User.search({
  query_string: {
    query: "john"
  }
}, function(err, results) {
  // results here
});

```

*NOTE*: You can also query Elasticsearch with any other method. Example: 

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/users/user/_search
```
